Corpse of a horse (Pferdekadaver). Men were not the only victims. The war destroyed anything in its path.

Collapsed trenches (Zerfallender Kampfgraben). For all its discomfort, the trench was home. Here the enemy managed to destroy a section of home and the scene is depicted almost as Armageddon. Two pieces of tattered cloth hover above the soldier. One resembles the Reaper, the other a vulture.

Transporting the Wounded in Houthulst Forest (Verwundetentransport im Houthulster Wald). During the war the automobile was put to work as an ambulance. Trains and steam ships carried the wounded to hospitals. Despite such advances, a wounded man often relied on comrades to get him off the field.

Front-line Soldier in Brussels (Frontsoldat in Brüssel). A soldier lurks in darkness surrounded by voluptuous whores in expensive clothing. In this view, they are nothing more than war profiteers. In reality they lived in dire poverty.

Skull (Schädel). The war provided a windfall for scavengers such as worms and maggots. Trench rats roamed as big as beavers. Gas was sometimes a welcome respite as it decimated these pests.

Crater field near Dontrien lit up by flares (Trichterfeld bei Dontrien, von Leuchtkugeln erhellt). Throughout the series, Dix demonstrates a commanding use of print techniques with etching, dry point and aquatint. Here a night-time flare illuminates a lunar landscape.

Mealtime in the Trenches (Mahlzeit in der Sappe). A trench soldier quickly gulps down a meal in the company of a human skeleton trapped in the frozen landscape beside him.

Dead sentry in the trenches (Toter Sappenposten). Throughout this series, Dix presents a wide array of ways in which a soldier can meet his death. Here, a soldier remains posed in the exact position he held at the moment the sniper's bullet found its target.

Roll Call of Returning Troops (Appell der Zurückgekehrten). The war took a great toll on all its participants. Here the living are barely distinguishable from the dead. They report to a well-fed administrative officer in a clean, pressed uniform.

Gas victims – Templeux-la-Fosse, August 1916 (Gastote). By 1924, people were aware of the horrors of gas but censored wartime reporting spared many from its ghastly details. Here the results are depicted with the raw clarity of someone who was there. Many were probably struck by the appearance of the victims, darkened for lack of oxygen, and the nonchalance of the medical staff.

Dead man in the mud (Toter im Schlamm). Mud defined a soldier's experience on the Western Front. He marched in it, slept in it, fought in it and often died in it. For the artist it offered rich textures which Dix captured nicely with aquatint.

Stormtroops advancing under a gas attack (Sturmtruppe geht unter Gas vor). Gas clouds the atmosphere in this other-worldly scene. The figures' features are obscured by masks and their fingers are curled like claws.

In the 1920s, Dix addressed not only combat at the front, but also life in contemporary Germany. In this image, realized as both a painting and a print, he took up the age-old motif of the card game, giving it a contemporary political angle. Gathered around a small table are three veterans, whose bodies lack large sections and include exaggerated and obtrusive prosthetics. Dix highlights the artificiality, showing wooden legs intertwined with table legs, for instance. The mutilated bodies represent the condition of veterans the artist encountered, many of whom were in dire physical and financial conditions and, despite their sacrifice, neglected by the government. Prosthetics and plastic surgery saw great advances during this era in response to catastrophic war injuries.
